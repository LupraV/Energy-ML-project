Members and main contributions
Joyce: CO2 Forecast (Sarimax)
Luis: Energy Forecast (ARIMA, LSTM, NeuralNet)
Luke: Relationship between GDP and energy usage  (Time Series, Linear Reg.)

Summary of the key points:

Overview:
The study examines the relationship between CO₂ emissions, energy usage, and global warming.
It also explores how GDP and energy usage can help reduce poverty in poorer nations.
The research assesses whether the largest economies are transitioning to renewable energy and if they are on track to meet carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

Methodology:
Several models were developed to forecast CO₂ emissions from land use changes, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gases.
The ARIMA model was selected to forecast the share of renewable energy for the largest economies (based on GDP) and New Zealand, after comparing it to LSTM and Neural Net models.
Time series analysis was used to identify countries that have significantly reduced poverty by increasing GDP.
Linear regression was employed to analyze the relationship between GDP and energy usage in these emerging countries.
